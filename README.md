# Guidelines on GenAI usage in science



## Misconducts

Plagiarism: claiming other people's work as your own or using other's people's work without proper **attribution**

Fabrication: making up data, results, facts, or citations

Copyright violation: using other's people work without proper **authorization**

## Good applications

### Writing

- revising and polishing the language of a piece of writing
- drafting bureaucratic letters
- language translation
- critiquing your work

### Coding

- creating web page layout and design
- writing a small block of code to do a specific, well-defined task, while supported by carefully designed unit tests
- applying well-written programming APIs to perform a specific task, especially a well-documented Python or REST API

## Poor applications

| Applications | Weaknesses |
|--------------|------------|
| writing emails | insincerity, verbosity, and fabrication |

## Non-applications

| Non-Applications | Potential misconduct | Alternative |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| summarizing scientific papers | fact fabrication | read the abstract |
| gather data | data fabrication | use search engine |
| analyzing data | data fabrication | write the analysis code, possibly with some GenAI assistance |
| generating scientific images | copyright violation | use vector-based image generation tool (e.g. Affinity Designer, Biorender) |
| writing or drafting papers | fact and citation fabrication | write the paper yourself first and polish with GenAI |

## Bottom line

Plagiarism, fabrication, and copyright violation are all serious academic or professional misconducts, whether you use GenAI or not.
GenAI just makes it easier for you to commit these misconducts.
