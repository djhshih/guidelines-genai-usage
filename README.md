# Guidelines on GenAI usage in science

While GenAI can provide productivity gain when used appropriately, it has also amplified the creation of unprofessional work dubbed "AI slop," 
without little effort from the users.

The quality of work produced by GenAI can sometimes be impressive, especially in the context of writing text that need not be grounded in facts
or generating images that need not be accurate. 
However, it is important that remember that AI-generated work often contains fabricated facts and data, because GenAI are trained to 
generate text or images that are plausible but not necessiarily accurate.
Therefore, the use of GenAI in scientific work must be done with forethought and care.

At best, creating AI slop reflects poorly on your professionalism and quality of work; at worst, it causes you to commit misconduct.

## Misconducts

The definitions of scientific misconducts remain unchanged in the era of GenAI. Common misconducts include
- **Fabrication**: making up data, results, facts, or citations
- **Plagiarism**: claiming other people's work as your own or using other's people's work without proper *attribution*
- **Copyright violation**: using other's people work without proper *authorization*

## Good applications

### Writing

- revising and polishing the language of a piece of writing
- drafting bureaucratic letters
- language translation
- critiquing your work

### Coding

- creating web page layout and design
- writing a small block of code to do a specific, well-defined task, while supported by carefully designed unit tests
- applying well-written programming APIs to perform a specific task, especially a well-documented Python or REST API

## Poor applications

| Applications | Weaknesses |
|--------------|------------|
| writing emails | insincerity, verbosity, and fabrication |

## Non-applications

| Non-Applications | Potential misconduct | Alternative |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| summarizing scientific papers | fact fabrication | read the abstract |
| gather data | data fabrication | use search engine |
| analyzing data | data fabrication | write the analysis code, possibly with some GenAI assistance |
| generating scientific images | copyright violation | use vector-based image generation tool (e.g. Affinity Designer, Biorender) |
| writing or drafting papers | fact and citation fabrication | write the paper yourself first and polish with GenAI |

## Bottom line

Plagiarism, fabrication, and copyright violation are all serious scientific and professional misconducts, whether you use GenAI or not.
GenAI just makes it easier for you to commit these misconducts.
